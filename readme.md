# 🧠 K-Manager — Personal Task Management App
Live --- https://v0-taskapp-simple.vercel.app/

A minimal yet powerful task manager app built with modern web technologies. This project started as a Chakra UI-based app, but due to compatibility issues and styling limitations, I migrated to the more flexible and developer-friendly **ShadCN/UI** component library.
